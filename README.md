Dantotsu is crafted from the ashes of Saikou and based on simplistic yet state-of-the-art elegance. It is an <a href="https://anilist.co/">Anilist</a> only client, which also lets you stream-download Anime & Manga through extensions.
<br><br>
<i>Dantotsu (æ–­ãƒˆãƒ„; Dan-totsu) literally means the best of the best in Japanese. Well, we would like to say this is the best open source app for anime and manga on Android, but hey, try it out yourself & judge!
