# 1.2.4

Hey there, the alpha app has now switched to getting immediate updates. (gets updated when the code gets updated)
This means alpha can now also have ground breaking bugs with it. (Previously, I avoided this so alpha were stable enough to use)

If not

## You will now be downloading the stable version of the app.
